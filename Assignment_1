Answer 1
Lists are mutable i.e. we can change the value in list. Lists have slower performance due to dynamic allocation.
Tuples are immutable i.e. cannot be changed.Tuples are faster than lists because they don’t change.
Using a List when we need to modify the data (add, remove, or change items) and using a Tuple when you want the data to remain constant (e.g., days of the week) and need better performance and memory efficiency.

Answer 2
Python supports implicit and explicit type conversion: 
1.Implicit Conversion (Automatic): Python automatically converts datatypes when needed.
Ex: x = 3  # Integer
y = 2.5 # Float
result = x + y  # x is converted to float
print(result)  # Output: 5.5
2.Explicit Conversion: You manually convert data types using built-in functions.
Ex: # Integer to Float
a = float(10)  # Output: 10.0
# Float to Integer
b = int(9.2)  # Output: 9

Answer 3
num = 10
num += 10
print(num) 

Answer 4
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")

Answer 5
marks=int(input("Enter your marks:"))
if(marks>=90):
    grade ='A'
elif(marks>=80 and marks<=89):
    grade ='B'
elif(marks>=70 and marks<=79):
    grade ='C'
elif(marks>=60 and marks<=69):
    grade ='D'
elif(marks<60):
    grade ='F'
    
print("Grade of the student is :",grade)
